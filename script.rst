D: Hi Brad
D: Hi David

D: What are you  working on.

B: Just trying to finish up our presentation for the Learning @ Scale Conference

D: Great, lets see what we've got

D: OK, looks like a bit of history of our two paper textbooks..
B: Yeah that seems like a long time ago, writing interactive textbooks is just so much more fun.  If only our other publisher were as forward thinking as Franklin Beedle, then both could be online.
D: As it is I'm happy we ran across the open source, How to think like a computer scientist to use as the basis for our CS 1 book.

B:  So should we show them a live demo?
D:  Lets be a bit more cautious, and stick to what we can show on your laptop.
B:  OK, I think whats really important is to show everyone that there are really two parts to this demo, the end product, that is, part 1:  our interactivepython website and the books we host there, and part 2: the runestone interactive tools that let us build all this stuff.

D: Right, so I think for the first part of the demo we should focus on demonstrating some of the different ways we are able to reach students who use different learning techniques.

B: I thought we would start with activecode, since that gets the most use, and it was kind of the aha moment with this whole project.  When we realized that we could embed a Python interpreter in the browser, and allow students to actually change the example code in the book I knew we were on to something special.  So, I've got my favorite fractal tree example here.

D: Ok, thats great but you kind of used the boring version.  Can't you add in  a bit of 

B: (while typing) yeah I'm on it.
D: So, this is just what we would hope a student is motivated to do, try the example code and then mess around with it a bit (ad-lib until Brad is done)  Thats much nicer.
B: And even though we are showing you Python here, the activecode could also be either Javascript or HTML, so you are not limited to only writing about Python.
